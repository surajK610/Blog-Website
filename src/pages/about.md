This is my personal blog. I mainly make blog posts that explain ideas that are interesting to me. Many of these ideas happen to be in the realm of current machine learning progress, but they are not limited to this. Please contact me if you have anything that you think is worth covering, I am always open to thinking about new perspectives!

I am a senior at Brown University graduating with a concurrent M.S. in Computer Science and B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics-Computer Science. My interests lie in research and engineering.
